<h1> What Worked for Me WODs </h1>

<p>
I talked about it a bit while narrating my screencast, but I was extremely frustrated at the start of it because prior to the successful attempt not only did I not know how to do the WOD, but I couldn’t get my emmet boiler plate to work. I was looking up online why it wasn’t working trying to mess with my settings and everything only to realize that its because i was working in a regular file not a .html file which made me feel stupid and even more upset. Anyway I had to watch the screencast once because I had an idea of how to do the WOD, but wouldn’t have been able to complete it. After watching it once I got a good idea of what to do. It was really similar to the lab we did previously because of the practice of tables usings strings and the document.write function. Honestly I had a hard time with the ending of the lab because I got lost on how to implement strings into the table with the example of the initials in class without the lecture posted to rewatch, but after rewatching it I was a lot more comfortable with the restf (hence why I’m writing this at 11pm the night its due).

Above is a link to this page as requested in the rubric of this assignment. For this WOD Invoice 1, we are to make an invoice/reciept using a table and variables from scratch, aka no hard coding. What slowed me down was forgetting that I had to use multiple script tags throughout the document to implement the strings. I didn’t really do much to prepare other than read through the instructions before attempting to get an idea of what was being asked of us. I understood that it would be decently similar to our last lab. To be better prepared I could’ve been more knowledgeable and actually understand how to implement the strings into the table. Not pointing fingers, but I would’ve been more comfortable and not had to rush if the screencast was posted sooner because I got lost at the very end of class which happened to be the most important part.
