<h1> What Worked for Me WODs </h1>

<p>
All three of the WODs were difficult for me even after doing the readings. I am completely new to coding and have a hard time following along in class which always requires me to go back and rewatch the recordings and constantly pause to input the code and try to understand the rules to html and javascript within VS Code. With that being said I did not complete any of the WODs before the DNF time on my first attempt, not even close actually. 
</p>

<p>
The first one, even though it required the most work, was the “easiest” of the three for me personally. For some reason I could not get my server.js to work properly so I ended up downloading a live server from the VS Code website which is free and very useful. It does not require starting the server and quitting it to input new commands in the terminal, even though there wasn’t really code we had to input into the terminal for the three WODs. The hardest part for me was inputting the links that would open by pressing the name of the browser that we connected the link to. I was not able to complete the WOD because I could not input the links so I gave up and watched the screencast. After watching the screencast and taking notes I felt a lot more confident that I would be able to process and understand the work I had to do. I did it again and was able to complete the assignment within the Standard time only referring to my notes once or twice.

The second WOD wasn’t too bad either which basically just required adding a css file to style our previous file we created. I did most of it by myself the first attempt, but got stuck on the fonts because I didn’t know we had to download it onto our index file and getting the images to stick to the left side with the text right next to it. After watching the screencast I was confident that I’d be able to do it and got it done in the average time.

The third WOD was definitely the hardest even though it had the least amount of “tasks” to do. I had no idea where to start, but after watching the screencast and taking notes I was able to do it within Standard time.

<p>
Overall I think the biggest takeaway from these WODs is to watch the screencast and take notes so that you have something to reference to if you get stuck without having to actually go back and rewatch the screencast.
