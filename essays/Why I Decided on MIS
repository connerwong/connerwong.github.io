I decided to choose Management Information Systems as my major at Shidler College of Business at University of Hawaii at Manoa because of a friend who introduced me to the major. I actually didn't even realize that we had to choose a Major within Business when I first started my college career at Kapiolani Community College. My friend is also a MIS major at UH and we are around the same place in our credits so we are taking the same classes. That same also convinced me to join the Army prior to me choosing this major and suggested a job within Communications. In the Army my job is labled as a Signal Support Specialist, also known as a 25U. I program and install security keys onto all of the radios that the Army uses and also set up sattelites for the radios to communicate on. I thought that a degree within MIS would be a good idea because it is similar to what I had just spent the past eight months learning and practicing. Although I admit what we have been doing in ITM 352 is much harder, I am excited to learn more about coding and get my degree in MIS. It would look great on my resume with what I do in the Army considering I would like to get into a job within IT and security. Taking the courses required within the MIS program will also help me become more proficient in computer knowledge so that I can get my SEC+ certificate along with probably a couple other coding certs as well.
